      "motivation": "# Neon Runner — quick run, big gains \n\n **Jump. Dodge. Focus.**\nNeon Runner is a fast, addictive mini-game built to test and celebrate short-burst attention, quick decision-making, and calm under pressure — perfect for approving focus, measuring situational awareness, and rewarding soft skills useful in coworking.\n\n---\n\n## What it is\n\nNeon Runner is a side-scrolling runner where your avatar automatically moves forward. You have two simple actions:\n\n* **Jump** — clear obstacles and gaps\n* **Dodge** — avoid low barriers and hazards\n\nSimple controls, *high* psychological payoff: quick reflex loops, escalating difficulty, and little wins every few seconds.\n\n---\n\n## Why play this for approval\n\nThis isn't just a fun distraction — it's a lightweight, measurable way to surface soft skills employers and teams care about:\n\n* **Sustained attention**: staying engaged during repetitive, focus-demanding tasks.\n* **Reaction & decision speed**: making safe, correct choices under time pressure.\n* **Stress management**: maintaining accuracy as obstacles accelerate.\n* **Learning & adaptation**: improving performance across short runs (shows coachability).\n* **Team readiness**: great as a warm-up for paired tasks or co-working sprints.\n\nUse Neon Runner as a quick checkpoint: a few short rounds + consistent improvement = evidence of focus and adaptability.\n\n---\n\n## How approval can be measured\n\nSuggested, displayable metrics (simple & objective):\n\n* **Highest score** (distance / points)\n* **Average survival time** (over 3 rounds)\n* **Jump / Dodge accuracy** (successful action rate)\n* **Reaction latency** (time between obstacle and action)\n\nA short approval rule example: *“Passed focus check if average survival ≥ 60s and action accuracy ≥ 85% over 3 attempts.”*\n\n---\n\n## Tips to win (and improve focus)\n\n* Start calm — deep breath before the run. \uD83D\uDC43➡\uFE0F\uD83C\uDFC3\n* Watch pattern rhythm, not individual obstacles — rhythm predicts what's next.\n* Use small, confident taps for jump; hold only if the level requires it.\n* After a mistake, reset mentally — each run is independent.\n* Practice 3×2-minute sessions rather than one long attempt.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested micro-challenges (for teams)\n\n* **Buddy warm-up**: teammates take turns; lowest score does a 1-minute focused breathing exercise.\n* **Adaptive sprint**: speed increases every 30s — see who adapts fastest.\n* **Blind callout**: one player calls upcoming obstacles while another plays — builds communication.\n\n---\n\n## Short motivational blurb (copy-ready)\n\n> Neon Runner is a short, focused challenge that sharpens attention, reaction, and teamwork. Jump, dodge, and beat your personal best — every run trains habits that make real work smoother. Play three rounds, show steady improvement, and earn the Focus approval badge. Ready? Neon awaits. ⚡\n\n---\n\nWant a slightly shorter or longer variant (e.g., for a tooltip, modal, or email)? I can trim or tailor it to fit exactly where you'll show it in Joolix.\n",
